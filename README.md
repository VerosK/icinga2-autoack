# icinga2-autoack

This script listens to Icinga2 API and acknowledges hosts and services
during their downtimes.  

It also acknowledges hosts and services with `autoack` variable set.

Why? Because there are some buggy notification tools which do not 
honor "in downtime" but does work with acknowledged state. ðŸ¤¦


## Code maturity

This program is in proof-of-concept state. But it is already used 
in production. ðŸ¤·

## How to start

Create Icinga2 API user in `/etc/icinga2/apiusers.conf

```
object ApiUser "autoack" {
        password = "mrznawrxbxbg"
        permissions = [
            "objects/query/Host",
            "objects/query/Service",
            "objects/query/Downtime",
            "actions/acknowledge-problem",
            "events/*",
            "status/query",
        ]
}
```

Create `icinga2-api.ini` in the directory the script will be executed according to [icinga2api][icinga2api] 
module [configuration][icinga2api-config].
In case you installed the distribution package from releases, this would be in /opt/icinga2-autoack.

```ini
[api]
url = https://my-icinga-hostname:5665/
username = autoack
password = mrznawrxbxbg
ca_certificate = ./icinga2-ca.crt
```

Copy  certificate from `/var/lib/icinga2/ca/ca.crt` to 
the directory, the script will be executed as icinga2-ca.crt.
In case you installed the distribution package from releases, this would be in /opt/icinga2-autoack.

Start the script (possibly in Pipfile managed virtualenv). In case of distribution package run

```
sudo systemctl restart icinga2-autoack
```
